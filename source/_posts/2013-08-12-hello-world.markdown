Hi, we develop software in Clojure.

Clojure is a high level functional language that runs on the JVM, integrates
well with the existing java ecosystem, provides sane semantics for concurrent
programming while being extendible and more productive.

We are a team of four, where each individual brings his unique background and
knowledge to solve your problem, effectively.
